This a new file of HTML. Now I'm trying to make a paragraph. Lets see how it works. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Minus velit est, cum quibusdam ipsum, accusamus dolor molestias adipisci animi vel nostrum repudiandae. Enim magni quidem repellendus eum recusandae, fugit asperiores.

<p>This is inside of a p tag</p>

This is outside of p tag. So, it means p tag takes a new line and this line also started from new line. So, p tag helps to take new lines on top and buttom of p taged text.

To use bold
<b>this is a bold text</b>

This is italic text
<i>this is a italic text</i>

Use of small tag
<small>this is a small tag</small>

Strong tag
<strong>this is a strong tag. This is a symentic(meaningful tag) unlike bold</strong>
